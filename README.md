A responsive front-end web application for a modern Hijab fashion brand. This project demonstrates a complete user flow from authentication to product details.

## 🚀 How It Works

Based on the workflow above, the application follows this structure:

1.  **Authentication Phase:**
    * **Login / Sign Up:** The user starts at the landing authentication screens.
    * Users can switch between "Log In" and "Sign Up" forms.
    * Upon successful entry, they are redirected to the Home Page.

2.  **Home Page (Landing):**
    * Features a hero section with the brand identity.
    * Displays a "Featured Collection" with three distinct styles (Winter, Casual, and Elegant).
    * Each product card allows the user to click "View Details".

3.  **Product Detail Pages:**
    * **Dynamic Navigation:** Clicking a product on the home page leads to its dedicated details page.
    * **Content:** Shows high-quality imagery and descriptions for specific items (e.g., Elegant Winter Style, Graceful Pink Elegance).
    * **Back Navigation:** Each page includes a "Back to Home" button to return to the main catalog.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and color themes.
* **JavaScript:** For handling navigation logic and button events.
